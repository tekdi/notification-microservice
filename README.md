# üìö Shiksha Notification Microservice

The Notification Service is designed to efficiently deliver notifications to end users. It supports multiple notification types including SMS, PUSH, and email, ensuring that users are informed promptly and through their preferred communication channel. This service is essential for keeping users engaged and informed about various events and activities within an application or system. To send notifications, we first create NotificationAction and NotificationActionTemplate to store notification actions and their template configuration respectively. These maintain details such as title, status, key, types of notification with its configuration [subject,body], created and updated timestamps, and more. Once these are set up, the system can handle notification requests, determine the appropriate adapter to use, log the results, and provide a unified response to the client.
